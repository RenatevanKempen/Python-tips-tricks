# Python-tips-tricks
Hi and welcome to my repo of Python tips and tricks. 

Here I will store all tips &amp; tricks for the use of Python that I collect in order to have them all stored in one place.

Do you have any tips or tricks that you want me to know? 

You can reach out to me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renatevankempen/) or send me an [email](renate@baime.nl).

Thank you! 
Renate
